# Changelog

All notable changes to Pulse will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) after its first stable release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Built-in administrator setup/login, private monitoring by default, session revocation, TOTP, and explicitly configured GitHub OAuth.
- Emerald administration for node metadata, visibility, enrollment, credentials, billing-period traffic, asset fields, and site settings.
- Bounded ICMP/TCP/HTTP probes with real latency/loss history, alert rules, incident state, and durable notifications through administrator-enabled HTTPS webhooks.
- Optional process/socket/GPU metrics and automatic country discovery with manual-region priority and an explicit disable option.
- Authentication and monitoring operator guides, a private-bootstrap Compose example, and regression coverage for desktop/mobile administration and real Agent probes.

### Changed

- The default reporting interval is three seconds; administrators can configure 1–300 seconds centrally.
- SQLite schema v3 uses a backed-up, forward-only migration; the Agent snapshot/enrollment protocol remains v2.
- Webhook delivery stays disabled unless the administrator explicitly configures and enables a destination. Payloads exclude IP addresses, credentials and raw monitoring snapshots.

### Fixed

- Keep OAuth network requests outside the session-change lock while rechecking revoked credentials before session issuance.
- Apply the same strict database byte ceiling during growth and restart, including non-page-aligned limits.
- Prevent stale administrator refreshes during logout and preserve real history across supported monitoring views.

### Upgrade notes

- Back up the Service database before upgrading. Configure the exact HTTPS `PULSE_PUBLIC_URL` and a private `PULSE_SETUP_TOKEN_FILE`, then create the first administrator at `/login`. An upgraded dashboard is private until an administrator deliberately enables public reads.
- Do not downgrade a migrated schema v3 database. Restore the pre-upgrade backup with the matching older binary if rollback is necessary.
- Existing enrolled Agents retain their credentials. Upgrade Agents to use automatic country discovery, extended metrics, centrally configured reporting, and network probes.
- When no manual country is set, GeoJS lookup is enabled by default and reveals public egress IP and Agent version, but no Pulse credentials or metrics. Set `PULSE_GEOIP_PROVIDER=disabled` before starting/upgrading to opt out.
- Publishing Pulse does not update or deploy Vastora applications. The matching Vastora executor integration and signed catalog publication are separate steps.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-09-09

The Alpha.1 release was stopped before publication after runtime verification found an Agent glibc incompatibility. Its existing source tag is retained without rewriting history.

### Added

- Initial Rust workspace and open-source project foundation.
- End-to-end node enrollment, authenticated snapshot ingestion, and retained SQLite history.
- Outbound-only Agent loop for CPU, load, memory, swap, disk, network, uptime, and platform metrics.
- Embedded Komari Emerald dashboard with card, list, detail, online state, and load-history views.
- Local Iconify subsets and packaged flags so the dashboard does not require runtime asset CDNs.
- Short-lived database-managed enrollment tokens, Agent credential rotation, node revocation/deletion, and local audit records.
- Production systemd/container assets, backup and rollback procedures, release provenance, checksums, and SBOM generation.

### Changed

- Replaced Emerald's finance-oriented fields with monitoring status while retaining its interface structure and styling.
- Made Service receipt time authoritative and replaced newest-row history truncation with bounded full-window downsampling and coverage metadata.

### Fixed

- Built and smoke-tested both Linux release binaries against a pinned Debian 12 runtime baseline instead of inheriting the newer CI runner's glibc requirements.
- Resolved packaged flag filenames consistently on case-sensitive Linux filesystems across cards, lists, details, and globe overlays.
- Made offline chart gaps explicit and excluded stale offline samples from current usage totals.
- Restored automatic dashboard initialization after connection failures and keyboard access to node status summaries.
- Added safe credential recovery after incomplete enrollment and accepted IPv6 loopback Service URLs.
- Made credential lifecycle commits durable, coordinated online backups with writers, and bounded latest-status queries by node count.
- Corrected deterministic asset checks, release cleanup on failure/cancellation, and third-party license delivery for Rust binaries and containers.
